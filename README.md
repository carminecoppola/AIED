# AIED
This project implements a system in Python for generating, solving and evaluating gameified exercises using AI models.
  - Exercises are generated by exploiting the OpenAI API (ChatGPT), including reference code and test cases to verify the solution.
  - The exercises, without a solution, are sent to DeepSeek, which processes them and returns a stand-alone solution.
  - The system then compares the original solution from OpenAI with the one generated by DeepSeek to assess its similarity.
